                                Every day, patients across the country need
                                blood — for surgeries, accidents, childbirth,
                                cancer treatment, and chronic conditions. Yet
                                finding a matching donor or a stocked blood bank
                                in time often depends on phone calls, WhatsApp
                                forwards, and luck.

                                This platform began as a simple question: why is
                                it still so hard to find blood in an emergency
                                when so many willing donors exist?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The answer was not a lack of donors — it was a
                                lack of coordination. Donors had no easy way to
                                be discovered. Blood banks had no shared view of
                                stock. Patients had no reliable way to reach
                                either.

                                What started as a small project to list nearby
                                donors grew into a full platform covering donor
                                registration, eligibility checks, appointment
                                scheduling, live inventory, camp discovery, and
                                emergency SOS requests.

                                For donors, the journey is short and clear:
                                register with accurate details, complete the
                                eligibility check, upload verification
                                documents, and get matched to nearby donation
                                opportunities or emergency needs.
                            </p>

                                For patients and families, the process starts
                                with a blood request — filtered by blood group,
                                city, and quantity. Contact details stay hidden
                                until a donor or blood bank accepts the request,
                                protecting everyone&apos;s privacy.

                                For hospitals and blood banks, the platform
                                provides tools to update inventory, manage
                                requests, participate in camps, and generate
                                reports.

                                as urgent and notifies matching donors nearby
                                within minutes.

                                designers, and healthcare-minded contributors
                                building this platform as a public-good project.

                                reflects real-world workflows — not just theory.

                                backbone of the platform. They keep inventory
                                accurate, respond to requests, and host donation
                                camps.

                                managing stock, requests, donor history, and
                                camp participation — along with reports and
                                analytics.
